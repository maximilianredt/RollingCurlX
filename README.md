# RollingCurlX with optimized parallel Requests

This is a Fork of http://www.github.com/marcushat/rollingcurlx.
It includes the possibility to add multiple new Links while the script is running and let cURL request them parallel.
This for example allows Crawlers to start with one page and visit all found links from page1 parallel.
Original RollingCurlX currently only visits one link after an other in this case.
